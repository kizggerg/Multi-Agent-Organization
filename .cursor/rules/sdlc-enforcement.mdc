# SDLC Enforcement

- Always use `docs/SDLC.md` as the source of truth for lifecycle steps.
- Start by identifying the current SDLC phase before planning or coding.
- Enforce required artifacts for the current phase before moving forward.
- Enforce PRD completion (including functional and non-functional requirements) before Stage 1->2 gate.
- Enforce design discovery outputs (UX/UI design spec, architecture document, threat model) before Stage 2->3 transition.
- Enforce user-story schema in planning: description, acceptance criteria, story points in ideal days, and criticality (must/should/could/wont).
- Enforce QA-owned test plan in Stage 3 and evidence traceability to test-plan items in Stage 4.
- Enforce test pyramid automation preference: static analysis, unit, integration, then minimal end-to-end.
- Enforce mandatory VP gates at stage transitions 1->2, 3->4, and pre-live 5->6.
- Run security validation at shaping, build, and release-readiness phases.
- If any escalation threshold is triggered, halt and produce a VP decision brief.
- Never proceed past a triggered gate without explicit human VP decision.
- Prefer `/manager` to coordinate multi-agent workflows and phase transitions.
